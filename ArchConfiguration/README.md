# This my newest backup guide

To when I f*ck something up.

## Introduction

We keeping it simple, `archinstall` will do just fine.
Since I'm currently following typecraft's series on linux,
I will simply just do as he do, with my own things added on top,
so Go [watch it](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsz00TDipIffGKMW4hmzmwXTvARXyJMn8) if you want.

## Arch setup

### Connect to the internet

```bash
iwctl
[]device list # If device is off: device $DEVICE set propetry Powered on
station $ADAPTER get-networks
station $ADAPTER connect $WIFI
# It will asks you for the password next
# C^d to exit
```

To check if you're connected, run the following command:

```bash
ping archlinux.org
```

If you're getting some repetitive output with 64s, you're good to go.

```bash
# C^c to stop running the command
```

And now, we do the fun stuff:

```bash
pacman -Syy # to update just in case
pacman -S archlinux-keyring
pacman -Sy archinstall
archinstall # simply do what you think is good for you, for me I'll pick gnome for the de
reboot
```

Now, we would have a running Arch linux with gnome desktop, what's left is just my personal customization.

> note: in case you want to run a custom script for something like Hyprland, you might not want to choose a de (desktop environment), so you might get stuck connecting to the internet, for that follow the next steps:
```bash
nmcli d
nmcli r wifi on
nmcli d wifi list
nmcli d wifi connect $SSID password $PASSWORD
# if you don't have git don't forget to get that as well
```
> note: In case some basic folder are missing (such as Desktop, Documents, ...) do the following:
```bash
sudo pacman -S xdg-user-dirs
xdg-users-dirs-update
```

### Customizing pacman

If you want to allow multiple packages to be downloaded at the
same time and some other cool stuff, just edit the following file to your liking:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/pacman.conf # If it seems confusing, read the docs
```

### My stuff

So, now we have a running Arch linux, with either Gnome, or your 
sexy riced environment, All that left is my apps and config files.

First, I need git to clone my dotfiles:

```bash
sudo pacman -S git
git clone https://github.com/catsucci/.dotfiles.git
cd .dotfiles # don't dorget the . before the dir name
```

Here you can find some of my configs that simplify doing some things.

So, let me start doing my stuff:

```bash
# Supposing we are in the .dotfiles
cp .gitconfig ~/
```

> note: Most of my stuff don't get copied out of the bat, since most of them have some packages as dependencies, so I just read docs or debug issues.

### Some useful apps & tools

```bash
sudo pacman -S firefox p7zip zip unzip unrar htop wget locate fzf man-db ripgrep tmux neovim zoxide ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd jdk-openjdk libreoffice-fresh vlc gimp inkscape obs-studio zathura zathura-pdf-mupdf flatpak github-cli lazygit python-pip spotify-launcher sqlite-doc sqlitebrowser adobe-source-code-pro-fonts adobe-source-han-sans-jp-fonts adobe-source-han-serif-jp-fonts alacritty bat bluez-utils cloc curl eza fd htop kdenlive noto-fonts-cjk noto-fonts-emoji steam texlive thefuck tldr wine
